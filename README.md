# AnimatedSpatialEcology
A rough how-to on how to animate spatial ecology data in R.

In this repository you should find:
  - The main how-to: "Animated_Home_Ranges_and_Movements_How-to.html"
  - A dummy dataset: "FakeTestDataset.csv"
  - A file that contains just the code, with no very few comments, set-up to work with the dummy dataset: "Animated SP Code Only.R"
  - Two example animations using the code and dummy dataset: "FakeSnake1animated.mp4" & "FakeSnake1MAPONLYanimated.mp4"
